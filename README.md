# SUPER HERO HUNTER

- This application will give the list of all super characters. We can search for particular character and add them to our favorites. We can see more info of a particular character.

- I have used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap and some google icons to develop this application and also used local storage to make the data persistant.

- The API I used to get the data of characters is http://gateway.marvel.com/v1/public/characters provided with ts, public key, private key and also the hash value for API.
